                <p>Frida lived a life full of pain, including an unhappy marriage to fellow artist, Diego Rivera.
                    Despite all this, she was an incredibly strong woman full of passion and inspiration. Frida challenged
                    notions of race and gender during her time and is now regarded as a prominent LGBT+ figure.
                    She channeled all her pain and suffering into her artwork, creating works that inspire so many to this day.
